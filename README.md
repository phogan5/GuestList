# GuestList
Based on a project given in the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes with my own changes and improvements.
Designed to help me practice string manipulation, **while** and **for** loops, and random number generation. 

The intial project was purely focused on list manipulation, using functions such as **.append()**, **.pop()**, **.remove()**, and such, but, having some experience with Python, I tried to make some improvements to provide myself more of a challenge.
